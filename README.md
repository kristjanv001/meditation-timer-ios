# MeditationTimer

Fully functional meditation timer built with Swift and SwiftUI. Unfortunately it did not make it into App Store because of minimal functionality.

- The idea was that when users complete a meditation session, they receive a motivational quote as a 'reward'.
- The app asks for permission to notify the user and it also integrates to Apple Health to store mindful minutes
